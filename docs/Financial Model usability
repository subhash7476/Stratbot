 HIGH PRIORITY — Directly Address Your Pain Points
1. Kalman Filter (5.1, 5.2) — Replace the Anti-Predictive Meta-Model
Problem it solves:

Your meta-model is anti-predictive on equities
Raw events have edge, but need quality filtering
Implementation:


# Instead of meta-model prediction, use Kalman filter as signal quality score
kalman_state = KalmanFilter(dim_x=2, dim_z=1)  # Track price + velocity
kalman_state.update(recent_prices)

# Only take trades where Kalman trend aligns with event direction
if event.direction == "LONG" and kalman_state.x[1] > 0:  # positive velocity
    confidence_score = abs(kalman_state.x[1]) / kalman_state.P[1,1]  # signal/noise
    if confidence_score > threshold:
        execute_trade()
Expected Impact:

Filters out counter-trend events during noise
Could push WR from 53% → 60%+
Works on 15m timeframe (your sweet spot)
2. Volatility Tracking (5.3) — Dynamic Risk & Fee Management
Problem it solves:

Fees eat 50-60% of gross edge
Need to skip low-edge environments
Implementation:


# Use Kalman + GARCH to estimate current volatility regime
vol_estimate = garch_kalman_filter(symbol_prices)

# Skip trades when vol is too low (tight ranges = fee trap)
min_volatility_for_trade = 1.5 * avg_fee_impact  # e.g., 0.75% 

if vol_estimate < min_volatility_for_trade:
    skip_trade("Insufficient vol to overcome fees")
Expected Impact:

Reduces total trades by ~30%
Keeps only high-edge environments
Could improve net PnL by 20-30%
3. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (6.1) — Better Symbol Selection
Problem it solves:

Only 2/10 symbols are consistently profitable
Need objective criteria for symbol selection
Implementation:


# Estimate OU parameters for each candidate symbol
for symbol in universe:
    theta, mu, sigma = estimate_OU_params(symbol_history)
    
    # Mean-reversion strength score
    reversion_strength = theta  # Higher = faster mean reversion
    
    # Only trade symbols with strong reversion + adequate volatility
    if reversion_strength > 0.5 and sigma > fee_threshold:
        approved_symbols.append(symbol)
Expected Impact:

Objective ranking of symbols for PixityAI reversion events
Could identify 3-4 more profitable symbols beyond Tata Power/Bajaj Finance
Validates which stocks suit your strategy physics
🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Risk Management
4. Lévy Processes (1.5) — Tail Risk Modeling
Use case: Model gap risk and circuit filter scenarios

Indian equities have ±20% circuit limits
Lévy jump-diffusion captures these fat tails better than Gaussian
Implementation: Use NIG or Variance Gamma to estimate probability of hitting circuits, scale position size accordingly.

🔴 LOW PRIORITY — Not Relevant Yet
❌ Black-Scholes/Heston — You're trading equities, not options
❌ MVO Portfolio — Only 2 symbols currently; premature
❌ Volatility Smile — Options-specific calibration

📋 Recommended Implementation Order
Start with Kalman Filter (5.1) — Quick win, replaces broken meta-model
Add Volatility Tracking (5.3) — Protects from fee erosion
Run OU Analysis (6.1) — Expand symbol universe scientifically
Consider Lévy (1.5) — After above are stable, add tail risk layer
